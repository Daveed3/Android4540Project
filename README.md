## What? 🧐
Gantt is a team productivity app that schedules tasks for a project where the timeline of one task can affect another. Completing one task early or late may shift the entire project timeline. The Gantt app allows the user to track their project progress, add tasks with a subsectioned team in mind, as well as subtasks that allows the user to add files or required skills needed for the task.

## Why? 🤔
Often keeping track of time is something we all struggle with. Keeping ourselves organized helps lead to better productivity. While better productivy leads to better results. Gantt helps solve this, it helps you keep track of your task and the time needed for completion.
